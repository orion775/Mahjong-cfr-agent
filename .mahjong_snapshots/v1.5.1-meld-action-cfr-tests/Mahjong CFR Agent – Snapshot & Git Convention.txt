# Mahjong CFR Agent â€“ Snapshot & Git Convention

This file documents the official procedures for snapshotting and versioning the project.

## Local Snapshotting (Manual Versioned Folder Copy)

We use manual, non-zipped folder copies to save project snapshots under `.mahjong_snapshots/`. Each snapshot is named using a semantic version tag and short description.

### PowerShell Snapshot Script Format

```powershell
$snapshotName = "v0.6.0-working-meld-pass-pon"
$target = ".\.mahjong_snapshots\$snapshotName"

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $target
Copy-Item -Recurse -Path .\* -Exclude ".git", ".mahjong_snapshots", "mahjong_snapshots" -Destination $target
```

### Notes

* Always change `$snapshotName` to match the current milestone.
* This system avoids Git clutter and retains all working code.
* Snapshots include all files, including uncommitted experimental changes.

---

## Git Workflow (Commit + Push)

For stable, working features, we commit changes to Git manually by specifying only relevant files.

### Git Command Template

```bash
git add engine/game_state.py tests/test_game_state.py
git commit -m "v0.6.0: finalize working meld flow with PON and PASS"
git push origin main
```

### Guidelines

* Do not use `git add .` to avoid pushing unintended debug code.
* Use clear, meaningful commit messages.
* Always commit only stable, tested code.

## Example Version Names

| Version                        | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `v0.1.0-init`                  | Initial tile class and action space              |
| `v0.3.0-pon-tested`            | PON logic implemented and passing                |
| `v0.5.0-pass-added`            | PASS logic and unit test added                   |
| `v0.6.0-working-meld-pass-pon` | Full tested meld sequence including PON and PASS |

This file must be uploaded when resuming work in a new session to keep snapshot and Git rules consistent.

*Last updated after v0.6.0 snapshot (working meld + PASS logic)*
